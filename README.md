# COMP 3308 Pima Indian Diabetes Study
The purpose of this project is first to evaluate various machine learning classifiers' validity and accuracy on predicting the Type 2 Diabetes with the Pima Indian Diabetes dataset. The classifiers include both self-implemented classifiers and built-in classifiers of Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis(Weka), a data-analysis toolbox with various predictive modelling utilities. After analysing the performance of various classifiers, the project will delve deeper into the machine learning classifiers used.  By detailed analysis and comparison before and after feature selection, this project will assess the correlation-based Feature Selection algorithm's effectiveness on different classifiers of Pima Indian Diabetes dataset.
